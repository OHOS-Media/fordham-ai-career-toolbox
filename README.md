## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (v16 or later)
- npm (v8 or later)
- MongoDB (v4.4 or later)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/OHOS-Media/ramresume.git
   cd ramresume
   ```

2. Install dependencies for all packages:
   ```bash
   npm run install-all
   ```
   This command will install dependencies for the root project, client, and server.

3. Set up environment variables:

   For the client (create `client/.env.local`):
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8000
   ```

   For the server (create `server/.env`):
   ```
   CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:3000
   PORT=8000
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret
   SESSION_SECRET=your_session_secret
   ```

## Development

Start both the client and server in development mode with a single command:
```bash
npm run dev
```

This will concurrently run:
- Client on http://localhost:3000
- Server on http://localhost:8000

To run services individually:
- Client only: `npm run client`
- Server only: `npm run server`

## Available Scripts

In the root directory:
- `npm run dev`: Start both client and server in development mode
- `npm run install-all`: Install dependencies for all packages
